For 4 emotions:
There is no script for creating the big dataset for now. It can be done by moving manually all the prepared splitted datasets according to test and train directories prepared in the New_Big_dataset_September2022.

For 6 emotions:
The same situation as for 4 emotions but the difference is that during research the IEMOCAP dataset was not exploited for 6 emotion recognition, so it was not added to the train and test set in the big dataset for 6 emotion recognition.
